### Statics

This provides the basic components the EngineeringMechanics modules are based on. It provides:

* Vectors
* Loads
* Trusses
* Summing functions
* Solve function
* Gauss Elimination
* Degrees to radians
* Shear-moment diagram

### Mechanics of Materials (Mcnx)

Building off the Statics module, this includes:

* Determine principle stresses
* Determine Mohr's Circle Components
* Generate Mohr's Circle
