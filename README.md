### Overview

This is a collection of code I have put together in my spare time. It oringinates from coursework completed in the Mechanical Engineering program at Montana State University. I have made this code available for anyone it may help; however, I do not condone cheating or any practices that might violate MSU's Student Code of Conduct or similar documents at other universities or institutes of higher learning. Basically, just don't cheat.

#### Updates

At this time, there are no new updates. This is a brand new repository. Explanations of updates will be posted here.

#### History

The code contained here was written to help me complete assignments in the ME program at MSU. It began with the realization that most of the problems in EGEN201 (Statics) were fairly repetitive and should be easily codable. I ended up going overboard and devoting a substantial amount of time to writing a function that would solve for reaction forces for any statically determinate system.

This helped me see problems in other classes that could be simplified with complex-ish code. Why do something for 6 minutes if you could automate it in 6 hours? You only need 10 repetitions to break even. I proceeded to create "solvers" for common problems for several other classes and continued to do so the next semester.
